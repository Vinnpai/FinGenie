[0:00] START - INTRODUCTION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Show dashboard]

"Hi everyone! Welcome to finGenie - an AI-powered financial 
management platform built during the Udgama Hackathon. I'm going 
to show you how this platform helps users manage their finances 
with real-time expense tracking, AI-powered advice, and 
personalized investment recommendations.

Let me start by showing you the main dashboard."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[0:15] PROFILE SETUP
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Click profile or show profile section]

"Before we dive into the features, let me show you the profile 
setup. When users first log in, they complete a comprehensive 
4-step profile that includes their age, occupation, monthly 
expenses, financial priorities, risk tolerance, and investment 
goals.

This profile data is crucial because it powers our AI chatbot to 
provide personalized financial advice. The more information users 
provide, the better the recommendations become."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1:00] NAVIGATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Show sidebar]

"The platform has several key sections: Dashboard Overview, 
Expense Analyzer, Spend Analyzer, AI Goal Planner, Investment 
Advisor, and Financial Alerts.

Now, let me show you the most impressive feature - our real-time 
Expense Analyzer Sandbox."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1:30] EXPENSE ANALYZER - INTRODUCTION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Click "Expense Analyzer"]

"This is our Expense Analyzer section. What makes this special is 
that it's powered by a real-time sandbox that simulates financial 
transactions continuously.

The backend generates realistic transactions every 5 to 15 seconds, 
simulating real-world spending patterns across different categories 
like food, shopping, entertainment, bills, and transport."

[Point to transaction feed]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[2:00] LIVE TRANSACTION FEED ⭐ KEY MOMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[WAIT for new transaction - THIS IS IMPORTANT!]

"Up here at the top, you can see our live transaction feed. 
Watch closely... [PAUSE 3-5 seconds] ...there it is! A new 
transaction just appeared automatically.

Each transaction shows the date, time, category, amount, and 
description. The system maintains 5 months of transaction history 
and continuously generates new transactions to simulate realistic 
financial behavior.

Notice that I didn't click anything or refresh the page - this is 
all happening in real-time."

[Scroll through transactions]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[2:30] CATEGORY CHARTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Point to bar chart]

"Down here, we have category-wise spending analysis. This bar chart 
shows how much has been spent in each category - food, shopping, 
entertainment, bills, transport, and other expenses.

The chart updates automatically as new transactions come in. You can 
see the current spending for this month across all categories."

[Point to line chart]

"And here's a line chart showing daily spending trends. This 
visualization helps users understand their spending patterns over 
time. You can see peaks and valleys in spending, which helps identify 
spending habits."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[3:00] HEATMAP
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Point to heatmap]

"This heatmap visualization shows spending intensity across different 
months and categories. Darker colors indicate higher spending, while 
lighter colors show lower spending.

This gives users a quick visual overview of where their money is 
going and when they're spending the most. It's particularly useful 
for identifying seasonal spending patterns."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[3:30] PIGGYBANK ⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Point to PiggyBank section]

"Now, here's one of the most impressive features - the PiggyBank 
tracker. This shows actual savings versus estimated savings.

The actual savings are calculated from real transactions - income 
minus expenses. The estimated savings are based on your salary and 
budget.

Watch this carefully... [PAUSE and WAIT for new transaction] 
...did you see that? As a new transaction was generated, the 
PiggyBank automatically recalculated the savings.

You can see the performance metrics showing whether you're on track, 
the percentage, and the difference between actual and estimated 
savings. All of this updates in real-time without any page refresh."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[4:15] REAL-TIME DEMO
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[WAIT for another transaction]

"Let me demonstrate the real-time nature once more. I'm going to 
wait for another transaction... [PAUSE 5-10 seconds] ...there it is!

Notice how:
- The transaction feed updated with a new entry
- The bar chart refreshed with new category totals
- The line chart added a new data point
- The PiggyBank recalculated the savings

Everything is synchronized and updates automatically. This is all 
powered by our backend sandbox service running on Node.js, which 
continuously generates realistic financial data."

[4:45] SPEND ANALYZER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Click "Spend Analyzer"]

"Let me also show you the Spend Analyzer view, which provides a 
different perspective on the same real-time data.

Here we have a pie chart showing the category breakdown, a line 
chart for daily spending trends, and summary cards showing total 
spent, number of categories, and transaction count.

This view gives users another way to visualize their spending 
patterns using the same live data from our sandbox."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[5:15] AI CHATBOT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Open chatbot]

"Now let's see the AI-powered chatbot in action. This chatbot uses 
the user's profile data to provide personalized financial advice.

Let me ask it a question: 'How should I invest my money?'"

[Type and send]

"As you can see, the chatbot provides personalized investment advice 
based on the user's risk tolerance, investment experience, and 
financial goals that we set up in the profile.

Let me ask another question: 'What's my budget analysis?'"

[Type and send]

"The chatbot analyzes the user's spending patterns and provides 
actionable budget recommendations. It can answer questions about debt 
management, retirement planning, emergency funds, and more - all 
personalized to the user's specific financial situation."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[6:00] GOAL PLANNER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Click "AI Goal Planner"]

"The AI Goal Planner helps users create and track financial goals. 
Users can set goals like buying a house, saving for retirement, or 
building an emergency fund.

The system uses AI to calculate how much needs to be saved monthly 
to reach each goal, and tracks progress over time. It takes into 
account the user's current financial situation and provides realistic 
timelines."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[6:30] INVESTMENT ADVISOR
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Click "Investment Advisor"]

recommendations based on the user's risk profile. It shows:
- Recommended stocks and ETFs
- Market trends and insights
- Retirement planning projections
- Portfolio allocation suggestions

All recommendations are tailored to the user's risk tolerance and 
investment experience that we captured in the profile setup."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• WAIT for transactions - don't skip this part
• Point with your cursor
• Be enthusiastic!

If transaction doesn't appear: Wait up to 15 seconds, then say:
