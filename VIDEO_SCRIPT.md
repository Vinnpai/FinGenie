### **[0:15 - 1:00] USER PROFILE SETUP**

> This profile data is crucial because it powers our AI chatbot to provide personalized financial advice. The more information users provide, the better the recommendations become."

### **[1:00 - 1:30] NAVIGATION OVERVIEW**

**[ACTION: Show the sidebar navigation]**

---

### **[1:30 - 2:00] EXPENSE ANALYZER - INTRODUCTION**

**[ACTION: Click on "Expense Analyzer" in the sidebar]**

> "This is our Expense Analyzer section. What makes this special is that it's powered by a real-time sandbox that simulates financial transactions continuously.

> The actual savings are calculated from real transactions - income minus expenses. The estimated savings are based on your salary and budget.
> 
> Watch this carefully... [PAUSE and wait for a new transaction - this is the KEY MOMENT] ...did you see that? As a new transaction was generated, the PiggyBank automatically recalculated the savings.
> 
> You can see the performance metrics showing whether you're on track, the percentage, and the difference between actual and estimated savings. All of this updates in real-time without any page refresh."

**[ACTION: Point to the numbers changing if they do, or highlight the real-time nature]**

## 🎬 **RECORDING TIPS**

### **While Following This Script:**

1. **Speak naturally** - Don't rush, but don't speak too slowly either
2. **Pause when indicated** - The [PAUSE] moments are important for dramatic effect
3. **Wait for transactions** - Don't skip the waiting parts - they show the real-time nature
4. **Point with cursor** - Use your mouse cursor to point at specific elements
5. **Zoom if needed** - Zoom in on charts and numbers so they're clearly visible
6. **Be enthusiastic** - Show your excitement about the features!

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

- **Transaction doesn't appear?** - Wait a bit longer (up to 15 seconds), or say "The system generates transactions every 5 to 15 seconds, so sometimes there's a brief pause"
- **Chart doesn't load?** - Say "The charts are loading the latest data" and continue
- **Page error?** - Refresh and continue from where you left off, or edit it out later

### **Timing Adjustments:**

- If you're running ahead: Add more detail about features
- If you're running behind: Speed up the closing section slightly
- **Total video should be 7-10 minutes** - this script is about 8 minutes
